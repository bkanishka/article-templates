		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Professor N. Subbu Reddiar’s Virtuous Thoughts</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A. Auxilia Mary</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The word ‘Virtue’ has a broad meaning. It can include all the good deeds by man. It is interesting to note that in Tamil literature, the practice of virtue, both in personal and public Tamil culture, is manifested. Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar’s references from typical texts such as “Tolkappiyam”, “Nannul”, Sangam literature, and “Aimperumkappiyam” etc. are worth notable. The author’s knowledge of religious literature is well expressed when he deals with didactic and devotional literature. In particular, the in-depth training in Vaishnava literature and traditions aids the research study. The author explains the virtues of love and the evils caused by selfishness and states that to live and praise the virtues of thought, speech, and action, one must have the power to keep the mind, language and conscience under his control. Being jealous does not make you resourceful and never leads to progress. Moreover, those who are jealous have not advanced in their life anytime. “When the heart is rotten by the dirt, the people are pleased by the dirt; Lord!” the critical claim of Thayumaanavar, needs to be given thought says the author. There were many witnesses in those ancient days when people lived a life of apostasy. They enlightened the earthy king and the common people raising them to righteousness. Even in the War attrition, virtuous policies have been strictly adhered. N. Subbu Reddiar, rightly points out the pride of the scholars and great thinkers of the ancient virtuous life. As long as there is ignorance and hypocrisy in life, all the misery that does not exist, would seem to be existing and thus cause great anxiety and fear. It would also stumble anyone without knowing the way to get rid of the suffering within. Therefore, the author says that well-being requires consciousness and the elimination of illusions. If we think deeply, we will know that all evils are born out of anger which is contrary to the grace of renunciation, and he suggests abandoning anger. Speaking of hospitability, the author’s reference to today’s luxuries that take place in the name of hospitability and the inability to provide real warmth serves as an example of his analytic insightfulness. This article explores Prof. Subbu Reddiar’s multifaced perspective of presenting the didactic virtuous thoughts in his works.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Although politics has been implicit in mythology from the Sangam period to the late nineteenth century, it has been passionately expressed in Bharati's poetry. Bharathi lived as one of those who tried to live without gaps in word and deed. Bharathi was a prolific writer who spoke out about the tragedies of life and gave a voice to the liberation of the common people. He is considered to be the forerunner of modern Tamil literature, who uprooted the paralyzed literature of the Yamagam and Madakku pa types among the ancient poets. Content studies of Bharathi's poems have been conducted by various scholars for critical purposes. Periyasamy Dooran's 1982 book “Bharathiyar’s Works a Review” and in 2006, a collection of essays titled “Bharatheeyam” by poet Meera are good examples. In it, Bharathi's content is shown in the national concept in the article “Towards Bharathi's Center of literary Creation” written by Tamilavan. On Bharati's literary theory, Dr. Sachithanandam, Dr. Manuel, Dr. Ka. Meenakshi Sundaram and Dr.C., Kanakasabapathy have researched the perspectives of the Formalistic Approach and Appreciative Method. They compare Bharti's theory of poetry with Wordsworth's ideas in English literature and establish that Bharti's theory belongs to the genre of Romantic Theory. This article examines Professor Subbu Reddiar’s versatility that highlights the strengths of the ten essays written by Professor in his work “Bharatheeyam”. Moreover, Bharathiyar is shown as the pioneer of Modern poetry and the father of lyrical poetry of dialogues has been` highlighted by Professor Subbu Reddiar is justified in the research article.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. S. Arul Selvam</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Agathin Alagu Mugathil theriyum’ is a classic proberb. According to Nannular, it is not an exaggeration to say that what one wears is a smile, inner beauty, a gentle face, and the foreword is also like that for a book. A foreword of the book is the glory of the book and explains about the book in a precise manner, That is, it introduces the book to everyone and enables them an opportunity to know the essence of the book. It gives an understanding of the book and not a criticism or praise written about the book. Before writing a foreword for a book, the main thing to be noted is the personality of the reviewers for that book. V. Subha Manikanar, who had written a foreword to Professor N. Subburettiyar's book “Agathinai Kolgaigal” (Inner Principles), says that the reason for his work was that he knew about the indepth knowledge of professor’s scientific thinking. That is, the main purpose of the foreword and it introduces the book to everyone and giving them an opportunity to know the essence of the book in a clear manner. This article examines the merits of the forewords written by most respected scholars including the former Vice-Chancellor Madurai Kamaraj University, Prof. V. Subha Manickam to great writers such as Avvai Natarasan, Kamban Adisoodi Phala. Pahalaniappan (student of Professor N.Subburettiyar) to the classic works of N. Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Domestic Ethics as Evinced by Professor</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M. Anu</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Human life is said to be intertwined with three events namely birth, marriage and death. These three events orderly take place in the first phase, middle phase and final phase of one’s life. All communities give importance to these three events. Birth and death occur to all living creatures that emerged on earth. The event of marriage belongs only to the human being. All civilized people have many restrictions and customs on marriage. Marriage is a social construct that seeks to know about the relationship between two minds, body, soul, revolt, emotion and about its spirituality. Marriage transforms a man from a husband to a father and a woman from a wife to a mother, giving them a higher status, responsibility, duty and entitlement in society. Marriage is the reason for the disappearance of the selfish thought ‘I am, mine’ and the appearance of good thought 'we are, ours'. Marriage binds two bodies as one life, it’s a cure for loneliness and purifies love emotions. Professor Subbu Reddiar had already realized the essential virtues to know about human anatomy for good domestic life. The present research explores and analyses the importance of life stages, human anatomy, physical elements, emotions, the superiority of the husband-wife relationship, its scientific perspective, psychological counseling, and guidance and provides suggestions for leading better domestic life with the ideas evinced by Subbu Reddiar. In this regard, the study seeks to examine Professor N.Subbureddiar’s way of evincing domestic ethics for society in a universal approach.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M. Asiathara</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking and writing a language without error is an important factor in language development. However, it can be noticed that even native Tamil speakers make errors in written Tamil. In his book ‘Tamil Payittrum Murai’ (Tamil Teaching Methodology), Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar is keen that the Tamil community will be able to handle their language more accurately by correcting errors during their childhood days. He has described the errors that can occur in written Tamil in contextual situations, correcting methods and the contribution of the ones who are involved in correction. This article, ‘N. Subbu Reddiar’s Contribution to Error Correction’ is based on three variants; spelling, word and sentence error corrections. N. Subbu Reddiar demonstrates misspellings caused by wrong pronunciation, inattention, and coarse language; Glossary errors caused by colloquial Tamil, lack of education, and use of the vernacular; and Syntactic errors caused by the wrong formation of verbs and the improper applications of conjunction/ case/ suffix/ auxiliary verbs. He also describes the methods of correction. He also points out the errors that arise in semantic contexts also. He combined the contribution of teachers and students in eliminating errors. The suggestions for correcting such as teaching the correct pronunciation, establishing grammatical knowledge, and repeated writing practice are being explored in this article. He lists misspellings, vernacular words, coarse words as well as corrections. This article examines what kinds of errors have been corrected by N.Subbu Reddiar. It also reveals N. Subbu Reddiar's deep linguistic ability, sound knowledge of teacher-student psychology, and his focus on transmitting the Tamil language to the next generation.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A. Indumathi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">N. Subbu Reddiar's love and involvement in education and educating children can be found in the book “Kalvi Ulaviyalin Koatpaaadugal” (The Principles of Educational Psychology). Through this book, we can know his concern for the future of society. This can be deduced from the fact that the entire book is carefully addressed to children under each heading. It also explains how a teacher dealing with children should act with examples. It also establishes that an excellent teacher is the only way to better explain the interpretations of education, psychology, etc. In the nature and measurement of psychology, the researcher finds that measurement is a new interpretation of N. Subbu Reddiar's logical thinking. His understanding of the relationship between psychology and educational psychology, and the purpose for which educational psychology is well established, enables one to understand his subtle field by interpreting the relationship psychology has with other disciplines. His knowledge in the field of science shows him as a scientist in the areas of man and circumstance, psychology and physiology. It explains the different age-based divisions, learning, modules involved in learning, types of learning, specialization of stimuli, individual differences, abnormal behaviors, etc., each with a clear understanding of the mass defects and discipline assessments and their way. Subbu Reddiar makes better instruction on the conditions that occur among children at certain educational levels.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>M. Induma &amp; Dr. S. Hemalatha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Humans used language as a tool to convey their ideas to one another but today there are many different languages in the world. As languages are different, so are the culture, civilization, and customs of the people who exist in the world. The literature also varies according to their lives. Translation becomes essential for other languages to understand the literature of another language. Translation is the process of translating literature from one language to another. Translators are those who translate literary work from one language to another language. Translators can also translate ideas from one language to another in the original sense. It is also possible to learn about the specialities of the language, customs and cultures of the people. Translators who translate in this way have the same qualifications, obligations and rights. Some skills are essential for the translator. It is those skills that make translation literature successful. He becomes the best translator only if the translated literature is successful. The translator’s relevant skills can be identified through his translated literature. Translational grammar and translational theories can be used to examine translated literature and find the characteristics and features of translated literature. Did a translation succeed with this? Or Failed? You can also find out. It also reveals the skills of the translator. Through this, one can know not only the skill of the translator but also the literal and technical features of the translated literature. Translation can be scientific, literary, or philosophical.

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>S. Rahini</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Kavimani is one of the most admired twentieth century poets in the literary world after Bharathi and Bharathidasan. The evaluation of Kavimani Desikavinayakam Pillai has been done by Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar. Therefore, this review article is based on the book "An Evaluation of Kavimani's Tamil Work" by Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar. The book reveals the potential of two personalities. Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar's performance skills and Kavimani's Tamil works are clearly explained. Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar states that Kavimani's Tamil works are suitable for children education. Following Sundarar's "Thiruthonda Thogai" which explained the greatness of other poets, Kavimani also sung about the pride of the poets. So, he was considered as the one who cherished Tamil tradition. The poem which Kavimani wrote for Bharathiyar appraises the value of criticism so Kavimani is exaggerated as the poet who gave the poem as a criticism. He also states that Kavimani instills human values through nature. Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar considers Kavimani is a great philosopher and theologian. He appreciates Kavimani’s poem as it tends the reader to visualize what they read. He also compliments Kavimani as he presents his poem being fascinated by the nature. In this way, Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar has reviewed Kavimani's Tamil work with his descriptive, analytical, compilation, comparative and psychological critiques and he also had the ability to interpret the poet's vision in Tamil that is based on a number of factors such as being a reviewer, as well as being an elite scholar, with an in-depth knowledge of literature, the ability to penetrate aesthetic sense, the ability to see what is in literature, the multifaceted scholarship, and the neutrality of likes and dislikes. Hence, this article explores the critical views of Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar on the works and ideals of Kavimani Desikavinayakam Pillai.</p>

He was considered the beacon of the nineteenth century to eradicate poverty. He was the first to wage war on poverty next to Manimegalai. His principle was to measure the universe through his works on philanthropy, individual morality, humanity, psychiatry, and the doctrines of the five principles through his works “Thiruvarupa” and “Manumurai Kandavasakam”. Professor N. Subbu Reddiar is a great scholar of Divine Literature in Tamil. He has a moral taste for moral ethics and philosophy. He had widely studied the Bhakti literature of Tamil literature. He introduced many saints to Tamil readers and scholars. One such epic sail is the study of Vallalar. He had made the life and philosophy of Vallalar in front of the readers in a grasping way. Hence, this article ponders over the stance of Professor Reddiar on the ideals of Vallalar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. K. B. Kanimozhi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. Na. Subbu Reddiar is a famous Tamil scholar, great writer and a great intellectual who shaped Tamil Literature by his writings. He is proud to have made his mark in the development of Tamil studies by delving deep into various fields like literature, science, psychology, pedagogy, religion and society. He had written 135 books and they have been nationalized by the Tamil Nadu Government. During the period when Tamil sentiment started to rise, Prof. Bharatiyar wrote a critical review of Bharathidasan's songs. Similarly, this book 'Kavimani's Tamil Work - A Review' arose as a result of the increased involvement in the 'Malarum Malayum' songs of Kavimani Desika Vinayakam Pillaiyum. The author of this book has collected the verses written by Kavimani in various periods and categorized them under various topics and published them. Professor Reddiar has analyzed the natural scenes and pictorial scenes shown by Kavimani in historical and comparative manner in his own way. Kavimani's “Kulanthai Padalgal” (children's songs) has been conveyed in children's language and stresses that plays and abhinaya are necessary to educate a child. Also, professor had identified songs with national sentiments, songs with social thought, and songs that can express language. Professor had explored the concept of God and the ideas of Thaumana Swami and Kumaragurubarar. He gives the reason for the name Sundaramurthy vazhiyil on his own way. He has praised it by comparing it with Bharatiyar songs, Bharathidasan songs, Bhakti songs etc. at appropriate places. One can see nowhere except Tamil literature like Kavimani had expounded on impermanence in the cultural elements of his songs. Through analysis, Professor Subbu Reddiar gives us the feeling of the poet who enjoyed nature and indepth philosoophy. “Marumakkal Vazhi Manmiyam” is a beautiful work full of composition by Kavimani. The work is designed lofty with refined ideas in such a way that the mind of the learner is awakened, blossomed and tamilized.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Tolkappiyam is the basic source of Tamil literature. Tolkappiyam's writing, rhetoric and materiality form the basis of the Tamil language and grammar. Terminology in the language also tells about modes of action in semantics through grammar. The Alwars and Nayanmars through their eloquence sang Tirupathikams and expounded them through Saiva and Vaishnava sects. One can get to know the mythological stories, the structures of the temples, the hymns of the Alwars and the inscriptions of the Nayanmars. The shrines in Ranipet district can be learned through the book “Thondai Nattu Tirupathikam”. In the history of the Thondai region, the life of Ilandrayan, and the reason for the name of Alwars are detailed. Saivism means the principles of the Shiva cult and glorifies the incarnation of Lord Shiva. The songs of the chief three Saiva nobles were compiled by King Rajaraja Chola through Nambiandar Nambi. Saiva scriptures are rendered mainly by Thirunnasambandar, Thirunavukarasar and Sundarar. It is possible to know that the news and books about Saiva Siddhanta have been published in the books of Na. Subbu Reddiar. The Alwars and Nayanmars who lived in the Thondai region used to go to the shrines, perform tirupanis, preach Thirunama and pray to Thiruperuman Shiva. It can be known that they worshipped, performed pujas and preached beneficial messages to the people with Thirunamam of Lord Shiva. Vaishnava and Saiva incarnations are glorified in the Thondai region.

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Professor Subbu Reddiar has made a great contribution to Tamil Literature and Vaishnavism. He was the one who made the world aware of the greatness of Emperuman Narayanan who made the Mangalasasana by going to the holy shrines of many Vaishnava Divine Places in person. He is the one who has personally visited and served one hundred and two Divya Desams out of the 108 Vaishnava Divya Desams and is a true devotee of the lord. Professor was the one who lived by saying that his chief duty was to do charity for Lord Vishnu. It tells of the Vaishnava divine shrines he visited and the glories of the greatness he realized and of the difficulties he encountered on the way to them. The Grand Vision of Perumal was not easily available. He won many turbulent circumstances and served Perumal. Usually, man has a nature by assuming an action has to be done and many misfortunes continue while doing it. At those times, they will immediately give up that action. But Professor Subbu Reddiar is different from all that. He was the one who has done it in the best possible way without changing the policy of having no matter how many hardships come; by putting all his miseries towards Lord Vishnu in the name of Devotion. In his texts, Perumal's sannidhi and the glory of the Goddess Thayar with Perumal, the sanctum sanctorum where Perumal resides are expressed with great reverence. One can see that about the news of the way to the railway station and how far to go in the direction from the bus station in his autobiographical works.

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a well-known fact that Tamil is the most ancient of all the languages of the world. Hence, it is conferred the status of classical language. To its credit, it has a huge volume of literary works and grammar books dating back to the pre-Christian era and down to the present age. The richness and the greatness of a language are mainly decided by the good books written in that language. For a language to continue to exist, its written and spoken forms should be in practice. The Tamil language has both these characteristics. Besides knowing the subject and the methodology of teaching, the teachers need to be acquainted with the rules and regulations of teaching. Teachers should also know how important their standpoint is in teaching. Teaching is a kind of exercise that the teacher imparts to the students based on the environment which surrounds the students. The teacher must unite the student with the outside world. Education is very important for a society to flourish. It plays a vital role in shaping the future of society. The teacher must create learned men and women. Professor N. Subbu Reddiar opines that teachers should be aware of the basic laws of teaching when they try to bring students to the outside world. Teachers help students get exposed to the world outside. If the rules and regulations of teaching which N. Subbu Reddiar quoted about in detail are followed by young teachers they will become good teachers. This article aims at bringing out the important rules and regulations which N. Subbu Reddiar suggested to young teachers to make good students.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. S. Sathishkumar</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Temples are treasures of art and symbols of Tamil culture. The Sangam literature reveals that there were temples to Gods including Lord Shiva, Lord Murugan and Lord Thirumal two thousand years ago. The temples are built on the Aahamam basis. The temples will be built to include the sanctum sanctorum, the sanctum sanctorum, the mandapam, the maha mandapam, the mukha mandapam, the nandhi mandapam, the flagpole, the altar, the tower gate and the circumference hall. These are all philosophically based. In general, scholars who have studied temple systems and temple philosophies are well-versed in theology. But the people who go to temples and worship them are ignorant of their philosophical techniques about them. Professor Subbu Reddiar had written about the high philosophy of temples in his book “Saiva Siddantam Oor Arimugam”. It can be easily understood by common people through the simplification of such in-depth philosophy of Tamil culture. Hence, the main purpose of this article is to document the simplification of the theories of Prof. Na. Subbu Reddiar's philosophical approach to the temple.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The epic ‘Kamba Ramayana’ will excel in time because of its epic standards. There are so many characters in this epic ‘Kamba Ramayana’. There are six Cantos in this epic. Hanuman’s character came in the fourth Canto and continues till the end. Hanuman’s deeds support the success of the epic ‘Kamba Ramayana.’ Professor Subbu Reddiar in his book entitled “Annal Hanuman” (Greatness of Hanuman) exposed the righteous deeds of Hanuman. He called Hanuman by several names such as the hero of a poem, an orator, a devotee of Rama, valorous Hanuman and a thinker. Because of Hanuman, the epic Ramayana ends in happiness, otherwise, it will be a great tragedy. Hanuman helped Bharathan to live long. Hanuman's words energized Rama after he discovered where Sita was imprisoned and that was the immediate turning point in the epic. The author reiterated that Hanuman is a great thinker. Although the thinking process is meant only for human beings, Hanuman had this quality through his devotion towards Rama. Further, Hanuman took twelve different images in Ramayanam. This was exposed greatly by Professor Subbu Reddiar. He exposes that Hanuman is courageous because of his mother Anjani. He affirms that Hanuman is a reliable messenger of Raman to Srilanka to meet Ravana. This was also rightly exposed by the author. Hanuman was a rightful devotee of Raman and Lakshmanan when he was in ‘Kishkanta’ he was introduced to them. Then onwards he was a dutiful devotee of them. In this epic, Hanuman was intelligent and clever and his special features are innumerous. It will be longer if one writes about him even if it may become as long as the myth of Hanuman’s tail. Hence, the article details the ideals of Professor Subbu Reddiar on Hanuman.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mr. S. SaravanaKumar</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Vemanaar was a renowned thinker with ardent skills. He is a man of bestowed knowledge and life into a society that has been arid of life. As a poet of high philosophical insights, Vemanaar denounces idol worship and strongly advocates human integration. Being a humanitarian, his writings propose the doctrine of worshipping one form of power to prevent the forces that endanger the integration of humanity. He voices for the economically downtrodden people, discriminated against and marginalized in the name of caste. His revolutionary poems stand for gender equality and create awareness of worldly problems, in both material and spiritual ways. Belonged to an era of pessimistic principles, Vemanaar raised their voice against evils and condemned those authoritarians courageously. The misconception was that his words were filled with brutality featuring him as an anti-activist. He lived a noble and purposeful life though few of his fellows opposed him. With the sovereignty and elegance of the Tamil language, the life of Vemanar is presented without changing the socio-cultural and religious scenario of his time. Vemanaar influenced society with his intellectual ideas that ignited awareness among the people. Subbu Reddiar discovered that his individualistic principles which made him a stalwart personality were abandoned by the authoritarianism of the elite theologians. This article by Subbu Reddiar about Vemanaar serves as a pathfinder for humanity to reach its noblest destinations. Hence, the article aims to bring out new traces of translating skills that would launch the highest realistic truths proposed by Vemanaar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M. Chitrakala</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Literature in the times focuses on hazards that hamper the development of society. Literature is a mirror of society. The aspirants of literature must be aware of and analyze it systematically. They will authorize: Will the aspirant’s presentation be beneficial for decades? Will it prevent the hazards of Society?

Considering and applying the above-said aspects literature can be trustful and applicable for many generations. Kamban in his epic “Kamba Ramayana” has depicted the development of the society and the code of Behaviour of an individual. The Character Vedan and the inanimate species Jadau (Eagle) in “Ramanayana” are personified as the epitome of good discipline and are adored even today. Kamban’s character Hanuman is depicted as an identity of social development and is revered for achievements and has been notified by Subbu Reddiar in his famous work entitled “Annal Hanuman” which adds additional crown and fame to Tamil literature. Modern Society is updated by innovations, which affects the social status of society. A self-disciplined society can flourish and progress by practising the moral ethics of Hanuman. This article explores how Hanuman protects humans from disasters and retains rejoicing and harmony. Hanuman by his teachings unites all the people, heals the hearts ailing from grief, removes despair and finally reforms them. In a short period, people regained hope, and courage for self-development. Hanuman’s devotional faith and respect towards Rama who is the epitome of power and his compassion for the poor make him magnanimous.

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Grace of Lord Thirumal in N. Subbu Reddiar’s <em>Thirupaavai Vizhakkam</em></strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. R. Sivakumar</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Tamil is the oldest language in the world. It contains authentic literary and grammatical resources. Devotional literature excels in Tamil Literature. One among them is the famous “Nalayira Dhivya Pirapantham”. The crown jewel among them is the hymns of “Thirupaavai” by Sri Andal Nachiyar. It serves as the magnum opus for the Vaishnavas. “Thirupaavai” is designed in such a way that everyone can learn the Vaishnava faith. It also creates research interest among researchers. Although there are many texts for it as commentary, summary, subject matter, and dissertation, the explanation given by N. Subbu Reddiar is authentic and graceful. It is readable by all sorts of people. The ancient society was portrayed as Aayarkulam which rely on cattle. Kannan was born a baby in the Aayarkula caste. He is the incarnation of Lord Thirumal. He is the God for the Ayarkula maidens. His grace was excellent for Aayarpadi women. He is the entire world to them. For this perspective, Subbu Reddiar gives the interpretation of the Ayarpadi maidens and their love for Kannan as evinced in Andal’s “Thirupaavai”, In addition, he further explains that bathing is a blissful encounter with Lord Kannan, as Aayarkula women bathe in the cool pool water at dawn in the Margazhi month for the fast and worship with the God. Here, bathing means Love-making on Kannan by Andal. Thus, the nuances of the blissful thoughts and feelings of Andal are explained by Professor Subbu Reddiar in his “Thirupaavai Vizhakam”. He also says that the hymns are pervasive by Thirumal’s grace in his book. Hence, this study examines the features of Thirumal’s grace in destroying the arrogant Mavali emperor, the giant Koman and the treacherous monsters, the love of Ayarkukla Maidens, and Kannan's love for all as sung in Andal’s “Thirupaavai”.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. Na. Subbu Reddiar is a renowned Tamil scholar who had contributed many books to the Tamil world. One of the books he wrote was 'Navukkarasar'. Navukkarasar was one of the four Shaiva poets who did charity through physical labour (Cariyai) in the temples. His other names are Marulnikiyar, Darumasenar, Thandaka Vendhar, Thirunavukkarasar and Appar Peruman. Thirunavukkarasar and Upper Peruman are also his names. The songs sung by him are featured in Thevaram in four, five and six of the twelve seasons. In the book, Navukkarasar, the life of the Appar Peruman, his journey with Almighty Lord Shiva and the benefits of his songs are explained to the people in a very clear manner. Thirunavukkarasar is credited with rescuing the Shiva temple from fasting in Palaiyar and receiving the best gold coin at Thiruveezhimalai. Also, in Thirumaraikattu, Thirugnanasambandar's songs praise Thiruvaimur Lord Shiva with his companion Thirugnanasambandar and went to Madurai carrying the Thirugnanasambandar's pallaku which had returned after defeating the Jains are noteworthy. According to Thirunavukkarasar's biography, the concept of 'Oodum Ponnum Samam' was generally sung by the Chekizhar. These are emphasized by Professor N. Subbu Reddiar in this book. His history is told based on “Periyapuranam” songs. “Thevaram” is said to be the historical evidence about him. Wherever there are differences of opinion in his history, relevant opinions are established with relevant sources by Subbu Reddiar. From the recordings on Thirunavukkarasar, it can be seen that Professor Subbu Reddiar has highlighted the songs. The readers of this book will have a complete understanding of the Appar Peruman. It creates the desire to learn fully about Appar from the writings of Professor Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. R. Sumathi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The Tamil language is a symbol of the entire Tamil society, embodying centuries of literary tradition and various literary forms. Historians have indeed acknowledged that Tamilians have long excelled in civilizations. World-renowned Tamilians excelled not only in civilized life but also in various fields such as religion, philosophy, astronomy, physics, biology, astrology, medicine, mathematics and engineering. During the Tamil language era, Tamilians have grown up acquiring many worldly concepts without any technological advancement. Thiruvalluvar has mentioned that knowledge is a tool to protect. Science is the subtle blooming in the formation of knowledge. Tamil arts and science focus on the inner and outer lives of human beings. Life is an indistinguishable duality. Therefore, life without art is not complete and life without science is not successful. Ancient Tamilians embodied many scientific facts in literature. The Tamil language has played an important role in the history of world languages since ancient times. As a Professor, Dr. N. Subbu Reddiar, a Tamil scholar, has established his scientific knowledge through pieces of evidence in literature such as ‘EttuThogai’, ‘PathuPattu’, ‘Thirukkural’, ‘Puranangal’ and ‘Epics’. His Tamil expertise explores the scientific thinking of Tamilians on world origin referring to the ‘Paripadal song’. He beautifully and emphatically articulated the ideology of enriching the goals of human biology into personal life and social life. Thus, the purpose of this article is to explore the meaning of Tamil literature from the scientific point of view of Professor N. Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. N. Sulochana</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar is a renowned person. He is a prolific writer, critic, researcher and professor who have written more than a hundred books. He was well-versed in Tamil literary genres like Sangam literature, Epic literature, Devotional literature, Minor literature and Contemporary literature. He is the author of “Kalingathu Bharani Research” and “Bharani Pozhivugal of Bharani literature” which comes under Minor literature. Literature travels to the next stage only when it captures the scenes it sees, the ideas it reads, and the messages it hears in a way that appeals to the reader. That is what Valluvar says in the chapter of "Sol Vanmai". Etymology is how language helps man to interpret what he perceives by his senses through the instrument of language. Language helps a lot to explain narration. A reader can visualize the pattern of Kali Temple, characters exhibiting expressions in the body, Omens, literary metaphors, the beauty of the autumn season, characterizations, overstatements, and personifications by the imaginative resources in “Kalingathup Bharani” through the books “Kalingathup Bharani Research” and “Bharani Pozhivugal” written by Subbu Reddiar. Hence, this article examines the technique used by Professor in detail to visualize Bharani using literary metaphors such as Uvamai, Oneban Suvai, Porulanigal, Yamagam, Madakku, Sileddai, Vellani Naal, Anjal alithal, Paavaadai poduthal, Velam, Paarvaikkarar, Nokkar, Thuruthiyaalar, Panjasayanam.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. B. Dhananjayan</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a boom in medieval literature in the world of Tamil Literature. The Vaishnavite Alwars gifted the glories of Lord Vishnu to Tamil Literature. They have made a great contribution to Tamil literature by giving rich poetic hymns of literary taste. The songs sung by the twelve Alwars worshipping Thirumal and praising his glories became to known as “Nalayira Dhivya Prabantham” (Four Thousand Divine Hymns). The commentators on the Alwars were the ones who made the world of the Divine prophets and their meanings known to the admirers of Vaishnava philosophy. Among them, Nathamunigal compiled the Divine Prabhandas and evinced their significance all over the world. It is the tradition of Vaishnavism to make Nathamuni the first compiler. After him, Vuyakkondar and the Manakkalnambi, Aalavanthar, Periyanambikal, and Thirumalayantan seem to have come under discourses until the time of Ramanujar. Ramanujar is a great personality to have brought about a great upsurge in the Vaishnava tradition. He first wrote the text with his disciple Thirukurugaipiran Pillai in Six Thousand verses for Thiruvaimozhi. This was followed by the complete texts of Thiruvaimozhi, such as the nineteen thousand verses of Nanjiyar, the twelve thousand verses of Vadikesarialagiye Manavala Iyer and the twenty-four thousand verses of the Periyavachan Pillai and the thirty-six thousands of the Nampillai. The rise of the “Thiruvaimozhi” text led to the Four Thousand Divya Prabhanda. Periyavachan Pillai is credited with interpreting the entire Four Thousand Divya Prabhandas. Hence, Periyavachan Pillai is called the authority of vyakiyana (Commentary). In that connection, Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar presents various concepts embedded in the ancient commentaries of Vaishnava Manipravala texts, texts discourses, discourse physiology phrases, dissociation of Tamil language, ascendant therapeutic philosophy will be the main feature of this research paper.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Virtue, Justice, System in Tamil Literature – Araththodu Nirral (With Charity)</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M. Dhanapriya</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Literature is what sets the goal for human life in motion. It is no exaggeration to say that the literature which records the lifestyle of the Tamils is the face of the virtues to be followed in the various contexts of their lives. The article provides details of the Tamil concept of life-based on the fourfold reality like Virtue (Aram), Material (Porul), Pleasure (Inban) and Salvation (Veeduperu). Knowing and following the virtues in the life of human society leads to living as an individual. Conflicts are natural in a social system. In such a period it becomes essential to follow a certain set of rules and live together without contradictions. Such morals were constructed by our ancestors as virtues. Although the way of life of human beings is changing from time to time, the basic virtues of their life can be found in various forms of Tamil literature such as Sangam literature, epics, and Puranas. Prof. Dr. N. Subbu Reddiar gave talks on the subject of “Virtue-Justice-System in Tamil Literature" at the University of Chennai from March 28, 29, and 30 in the year 1987 on the concepts of jurisprudence and literary systems mentioned in grammatical literature such as “Tolkappiyam”, “Nannul”, “Sangam literature”, “Aimperuppiyam” etc. In printed form, the book has been published under the title "Virtue, Justice and System in Tamil Literature". In the subsection on the meaning of virtue in Tamil literature, the biographical virtues compiled by the author such as purity of mind, intrinsic biological virtue, virtue in devotion, domestic goddess, hospitality, hospitality, denial of animals, monasticism, war ethics, etc., have been elicited in a detailed manner. Hence, it is worthy to scrutinize the work of Subbu Reddiar to get the full meaning.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Kambaramayanam </em>from the Perspective of N. Subhu Reddiar</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M. Dhanalakshmi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a well-known fact that Tamil is the most ancient of all the languages of the world. Hence, it is conferred the status of the language. To its credit, it has a bulk volume of literary works and grammar texts. Dating back to the pre-Christian era down to the present age, Tamil is divided into Sangam Literature, Moral Literature, Epics and Modern Literature, Epics etc. As epics are very lengthy in size they are also known as long narrative poems. “Thandi Alangaram” gives us a detailed account of the rules and regulations for writing epics. “Kambaramayamam” was written by Kambar based on Valmigi's “Ramayana”. Though there are many research books available on “Kambaramayanam”, N.Subbu Reddiar's critical books are very famous. Reddiar approached “Kambaramayanam” from the viewpoint of culture. His analysis of the character of Hanuman is excellent. He brings out the character of Hanuman in the form of a vision to our eyes. While compared to Valmiki's “Ramayana”, “Kambaramayana” is rich in the portraiture of culture. Parental love, brotherly love, people's mentality, beliefs and customs are beautifully brought out by the out Professor Subbu Reddiar. The scope of this paper is to show how Professor Subbu Reddiar has excellently analyzed “Kamba Ramayanam” with his in-depth study.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Internal Ethics (Agathinai) in the Study of Prof. Na. Subbu Reddiar</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>M. Nithyalakshmi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">One can learn from the Sangam literature that the Sangakala people lived their lives with certain morals. They have divided these types of morals into two types, internal (Agam) and external (Puram). Tolkappiyar has divided the internal disciplines into two disciplines: Kalavu (Secret Love) and Karpu (Chaste Love). The Agam life-style is also categorized as Punarthal, Pirithal, Iruthal, Irangal, Oodal, Perunthinai and Kaikilai, according to the suitable natural environment. The Sangam literature reveals that the Sangam period was characterized by a variety of land distinctions that divided the land into ecological and climatic regions for each land and bestowed praise on the way of life and morals of the people. According to Tolkappiyar, internal life is two types Secret Love and Married Love. The secret love is the deep love of the Thalaivan (Leader) and Thalaivi (Beloved) pure love that others will not give. The ancients marked the coexistence of lovers with morality, just as we call the scriptures “hidden scriptures”, which means that the Kalavu life of the lover and the beloved is pure and when they marry, it is called Karpu Kadal. Karpu Kadal is about the marriage of the leader and the beloved who enjoyed the Kalavu Kadal now has made an immortal transformation into social life. The Sangakala people called the marriage customs Karanam. Tolkappiyar points out that the wedding ceremony of Karanam took place without the parents. The leader and the beloved agree to marry by elopement (Udanpooku). The custom of beating drums, Chonch blowing, and chanting were practised in the Sangam times. It is noteworthy that in the book of Internal Life Policies (Agathinai policies) from Professor Subbu Reddiar’s point of view. He has explained in detail about the internal life-style of the Sangam people and the Agam principles.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. G. Padmanabhan</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaivam is one of the ancient religions that still exist in India. Monuments of Indus Valley civilization and parts of Vedic literature are the early evidence of Saivism. The presence of Shaivism can be traced to the era of the Pre-Sangam Age by the sources of Sangam texts. Literature of the Pallava period explains the re-emergence of Saivisam; in the subsequent period, the literature produced by Cholas portrays the glory of Shaivism. “Saiva Samaya Vilakku” the book written by Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar explained the concept of Saiva Siddhantha to the benefit of the common man. Other than this work, the author produced another book named “Saivasidhantham Oru Arimugam”. Professor N. Subbu Reddiar authored separate books in which he explained the contribution of Thiruganasambandar, Thirunavukkarasar, Sundarar, Manikkavasakar, Thaiyumanavar, Pattinathar and their contribution to the Shaivism and Tamil Bhakti Literature. The book “Saiva Samaya Vilakku” has six chapters. The book has been in the form of that a great scholar name Karthikeyan who has immense knowledge of Saivasiddhantha explains its eminence to a young person named Kannuthalappan through fifty-one letters.

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Charity in Ethical Literature Evinced by Na. Subbu Reddiar</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. J. Papeetha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Na. Subbureddiar lived his life gloriously glorifying his mother tongue Tamil. He crawled in the lap of the ever-famed Tamil and worked consciously to spread Tamil all over the world, and stood firm in the minds of the people of the Tamil world. He was a versatile man who had written many books. He had also written many books on the virtues that people should follow in their lives. This article is to know the quality of charity as seen in the ethical literature of Tamil Literature. The word EGAI means to give something to others for help, to alleviate the poverty of others. So, the foremost of the virtues is charity. Because other virtues are only useful to those who do them. The charity is beneficial not only to the doers but also to the recipients. Professor Reddiar’s view is that giving charity should be carried out as a humanitarian norm. A good one should see the poverty and suffering of others as his suffering and helps them by giving them what they need. The professor says that the family man must try to alleviate the plight of the poor with a lovable facial expression, and that is the best way to curb the problem of others. It conveys the idea that one should give what we owe, that we should give without considering any exchange, and that one should donate without an expectation that it will come multiple times to the benevolent one. He says that it is the duty of the very rich to carry out the virtues, which will create a world free of poverty. Furthermore, Professor Subbu Reddiar makes it clear that it is not possible to attain the meaning of virtuous life if one thinks that one should enjoy wealth. The ethic literature helps us to understand life, especially through the lives of our ancestors. In that case, Prof. Subbu Reddiar has detailed the values of charity and donation in his works so, the article decodes the ideas related to charity from the writings of Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Professor Subbu Reddiar’s US Travel Experience</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>K. Prabakaran</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Professor Subbu Reddiar had American travel experience in his 88th life and registered his experiences through the book “My Journey to America” (En America Payanam). In line with the joyous experience of Travel, Professor Reddiar gave us the experience of his trip to the US like the taste of milk mixed with honey in the Tamil Language. Through this article, as a researcher, I also share the experience I gained while reading this book. In an age, when the cost was considered as a journey, now, travel is an expense and going to America relies on a dream for most people but Professor Reddiar recalled his experiences and satisfy others' dreams through his book, “My Journey to America”. The uniqueness of this book is that it presents this travel experience with a lot of Tamil-language evidence to tell people in Tamil, especially Tamils. When one reads the information about each of the places featured in the professor's book, we all get the domain experience of going there ourselves. This is another feature of this travelogue. This article is designed to illustrate the professor's Tamil-speaking experience in a far land. In this work, one can see how the words are used in the poems written there to mean places and his experience. The structure of the book as a Tamil translator for English can be expressed here as 1,2,3, and the English words at the bottom of each page can be read throughout the book as some information can also be read in this paper for better understanding. Perungavi's poems have been quoted related to Niagara Falls in comparison. It is also worth exploring how Professor's experiential devotional literature compares many of the chanting and worship practices of each of the temple visions to his visit to the United States. As mentioned above our professor also tells Shaiva and Vaishnava cults and the architectural systems of America revealing the specialities of homelands. The culture, customs and other social conditions of the people of that country are also described. Hence, the main purpose of this article is to expose the dignity of Tamil culture through the temples, parks and museums he found in the four states of the country in his travel experience.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. R. Preetha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Professor Na. Subbu Reddiar was born in a farming family in Perakambi, Trichy District. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from Soosaipar College, Trichy, a Masters degree from the University of Chennai and a PhD from Tirupathi Thiruvenkatavan University. He is very fond of Tamil. He is the author of 130 books in the fields of teaching, Tamil literature, religion, philosophy, performance, history, biography, science and research. He belonged to the Veera Saiva Sect yet he is very devoted to Vaishnavism. They have devised several strategies at each time to interact with the reality. The worship strategies devised by the Vaishnava sages are unique. Devotion opens like a veil when the Vainava idols are not merely symbolic, but each is an Avatar and is associated with reality as an Archavatara taken by the Lord Vishnu. He has written revisions so that those who read such a fact will also realize it. His travel books include “Malai Nattu Tiruppathis”, Thondai Nattu Tirupatis, Pandinatu Tirupatis, Northern Tirupatis and Cholanattu Tirupatis. With information on the location of temples in hill station Tirupatis, one can find not only Vaishnava philosophies, devotional positions, traditions, rituals, historical evidence but also the specialties of the Lord Vishnu and Subbu reddiar’s devotion on HIM. There are thirteen Mount Tirupathis that have been categorized by the Alvars into four divisions. They are Thiruvanparicharam, Thiruvattar and Thiruvananthapuram as three divisions; Thiruvittuvakodu and Thirunavaya are the fourth. Thirumangai Alwar is the one who excelled in the above three categories. Kulasekara Perumal was the only to excel in one category.

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. L. Poornima Jothi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">This research paper is based on the ideas contained in the book Pavender's (Bharathidasan) Poetry Review (“Pavendar Pattuthiran Thiranaivu”) from Professor N. Subbu Reddiar's point of view. Emotions take precedence in every human being. They play an important role in writing poetry. According to the Pavendar, there is an in-depth meaning in the poem. Emotions can vary depending on the formation of words. Social reform movements will stir our emotions; Pavendar’s poems have such themes. The poet conveys the point in the poem that he is trying to convey a strong theme in his poems. It has been investigated in this research. Professor N. Subbu Reddiar had done a lucid study on the poetry of Pavendar and made it easy for understanding to his readers. Narration is one of the aesthetic interpretations of natural objects. These comments are examined in two ways. Allegorical skill is the first in poetry. A simile is another way of comparing one thing to another. Subbu Reddiar's perspective on Pavendar’s vision is detailed keenly. Something unknown to the five senses is imagination. The way of explaining imagination is explained in three ways namely creative imagination, natural imagination, and conceptual imagination. Subbu Reddiar is said to have explained the images from various angles. Professor has found the use of supreme poetry in the poems of Pavendar Bharathidasan. There are nine elements in Tamil poetry. Yapu is written in the form of Paa. They are as Venba, Aasiriyapaa, and Kalipaa. The research paper aims to explore the above-mentioned qualities of Pavender’s poetry as evinced by Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. N. Subbu Reddiyar has recorded the beauty of the Sun in various contexts and looks at it from a scientific point of view like Kambar who recorded the beauty of the sun in various stages in his epic “Kambaramayana”. Professor Reddiar has outlined the scientific points and literary style of Kambar in his works. The people of Tamil Nadu celebrate the Pongal festival as an important festival as a way of giving thanks to the Sun which gives hope to the farmers. Pongal festival in Tamil Nadu has been a festival for the Sun and is celebrated by all people. On Pongal, people worship the sun which gives light and heat. The scientific fact is that the Sun is the ultimate source of all energy. Kambar discovered in his life about dividing the atom into a hundred parts. So, the Gods can be one. Kambar has traditionally sung the sunrise at the beginning of most of his epic, and the sunset at the end, in more than a hundred songs. In the six cantos, Sun is portrayed as a symbol of neutrality, eloquence, knowledge, and energy. Both natural and vivid descriptions were in his poems. It is a fact that today most of the villagers are the ones who give importance to the light and grace of the Sun. Prof. Reddiar has given much attention to Sun in his works. So, This article is based on the study of nature worship, Sun Worship, Consciousness, Unconsciousness, Sunrise, benefits of the Sun, Energy, Lightning, Sunday Worship, Worship of Lord Shiva and History etc that are found in the writings of Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. R. Manimegalai</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. Na. Subbu Reddiar has been published texts in various contexts. He has written hundreds of books in the fields of religion, philosophy, literature, grammar, sociology, science and children's literature and has made great contributions to Tamil Society. The majority of the texts written by the professor are religious. Prof. Na. Subbu Reddiar's book, “Introduction to Saiva Sidhantham”, explains the basic tenets of Saivam. In this book, he explains the philosophy of Saiva Sidhantham in a deep logical approach. Although the philosophical principles in Tamil have been developed through epics since the Sangam period, only “Panniru Thirumurai” form the basic texts of Tamil Saivam philosophy. Saiva Sidhantham has a unique place in the Indian philosophical tradition and is the basis for cultural heritage. Saiva Sidhantham is a philosophy that arose based on three facts. They are Pathi, Pasu, Paasam. This is called a triplet. In the introduction of this book, Prof. Subbu Reddiar has created based on the data on these ideals from Tamil spiritual texts. Prof. P. Krishnan mentions and records “Saiva Sidhantham Or Arimugam” as the first study book on Saiva Siddhanta. In the book, the professor writes logically on the three-dimensional interpretation of two thousand years of philosophical philosophies based on enlightenment, fact-finding, and theory</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Tamil proverb “A Flame Lamp always needs a stimulus. Professor Subbu Reddiar lit a Saiva renaissance and performed dedicated service to Saiva Bhakti literature. He also delineated Manikkavasakar's concepts Mukti Neri, and Bhakti Neri and clarifies the truth simply related to the devotional norms. Cēkkiḻār praised the history of the 63 Nayanmars in his “Periya Puranam”. Manikkavasagar’s “Tiruperundurai” has been described in awe what the fears and anxieties of the enlightened one in worldly life with the spiritual acts. Manikkavasakar also explained the merits of the Shivaneri ideology. The shiva principles tell about the three malevolent things that a man should avoid. They are Anava (Pride), Kanma (Hypocrisy) and Maya (Illusion) prevalent among human beings and the darkness that lurks outside them. When Manikkavasakar moves towards Thiruvannamalai on a pilgrimage, Markazhi Monday comes with the divinity power 'Thiru' and the power of 'EM' (Individual) combined with the vitality of the genre 'Pavai'. Standing outside the perception of Manikkavasaka's Thiruvembavai, Professor Reddiar has highlighted that the worldly life is the union of Shiva and Shakti intellectually in his writings. Manikkavasakar sings and turns in heartfelt introspection, worshipping the Lord of Thirukovaiyar and making himself the lover of the Lord and the leader who wants to attain the bliss of the Lord's Thiruvadi. Professor’s views of the spiritual riches of the works of Manikkavasakar are admirable. Hence, the article elicits the chosen ideas of Saiva Poet Manikkavasakar from Subbu Reddiar’s perspective.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><strong>A Dialectic View of Professor N. Subbureddyar in Inner Life (Agathinai) and External Life (Purathinai)</strong></strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><strong>E. Munni &amp; Dr. S. Hemalatha</strong></strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><strong>Abstract</strong></strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">“Tolkappiam” is an ancient Tamil literature book written by Tolkappiyar. This Tamil treatise on grammar and life deals with the ancient Sangam lifestyle. “Tolkappiam” also says about the inner spirit and external capabilities of ancient life. The inner life (Agam) deals with love, compassion, affection, and forgiveness; the external life (Puram) reveals courage, valour, generosity and war ethics. This is how the two sides of human life are considered in the Tamil research world but Professor N. Subbu Reddiar in his version of “Tolkappiyum” has researched in another perspective contrary to the above-stated ideas that are related to socio-economic hierarchy, growth and status of the people based on the Sangam habitats in regard with the regions and environmental conditions. Tholkappiyar has classified the earth into Five Regions as Hilly Regions (Kurunchi), Forests Regions (Mullai), Farmlands (Marutham), Coastal (Neithal) and Desert (Palai) regions. Professor N. Subbu Reddiar has seen a perspective related to the lifestyle and status of the people. His “Tolkappiyum” describes in detail the lifestyle lived by the Sangam people with a tinge on the culture and heritage of the Tamil People of Ancient and Medieval Times. The lifestyle, culture and heritage of the people of the ancient and medieval times of Tamil Nadu had been investigated by Mr. Reddiar under the scrutiny of “Tolkappiam” and “Thirukurral”. Professor N. Subbureddiyar suggests that this literature should be considered for the betterment of the life of every human on the earth. Regarding to the lifestyle of humans and culture said by Tolkappiar; Professor N. Subbu Reddiar authored the same ideals from a different perspective in his book “Lifestyle shown as in ‘Tholkappiam” (Tolkappiam Kattum Valkai)’.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><strong>Dr. P. S. Mooventhan</strong></strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><strong>Abstract</strong></strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Virtue is the chief moral code of common life in Tamil society. Virtues arose with the primary aim of emphasizing virtue. “Tirukkural” is the chief among the didactic books. “Tirukkural” has created many ideas with very few words like the English saying “Brevity is the Soul of Wit. Professor Subbu Reddiar studied the concept of “Tirukkural” in his commentary, speech and writing. Such interpretations were in texts, paraphrases, translations, textual interpretations, and textual refutations. Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar has authored many books related to “Tirukkural” and didactic books. One of them is ‘Vaḷḷuvariṉ Vāḻviyal Cintaṉaikaḷ’. This is a testament to Professor's introspective vision. In this book, he has explained the meaning of virtue and how it has been followed in Tamil tradition. The virtues created by “Tirukkural” and its functions, the need for virtue in life, the virtues and the ability of Tirukkural's thoughts are seen in his works. In this way, this book also serves as an explanatory manual for “Tirukkural”. In this, he has revealed the meaning of virtue, material, and pleasure in terms of virtue in virtue, virtue in material, and virtue in pleasure. Moreover, he has tried to realize through this book that virtue is proof of the excellence of the Tamil language. He has also shown that he has been continuously associated with “Tirukkural” since his youth with his life events. In this article, Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar's ability to analyze “Tirukkural” with Tamil life and the compatibility of “Tirukkural” with his life has been evident. Hence, the objective of this research paper is to examine the importance of virtue, meaning, and pleasure, and the relevance of virtue with evidence through the book ‘Valluvarin Vaazhviyal Sinthanaigal’.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. P. Vimala</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. Dr. N. Subbu Reddiar is a profound Tamil scholar who had studied many grammar, literature, religion and science-related artefacts in the Tamil language. He is a prolific writer in the fields such as grammar, literature, genealogy, poetry and religion. Thanthai Periyar's principles of atheism, the negation of superstitions, the development of rationality, the abolition of castes, abolition of female slavery are known as Periyarism. Prof. Dr. N. Subbu Reddiar had an immense love for Thanthai Periyar even though he was spiritual in nature. He wished to research Thanthai Periyar’s thoughts and expressions as much as other nobles like Ramanujar, Thayumanavar, Ramalinga Swamigal, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and others. In 2001 at the Anna Public Center, the University of Madras organised an endowment lecture in the name of Professor C.A. Perumal, where he delivered a series of lectures on Thanthai Periyar. In the first lecture, he decoded the excogitation of Periyar's stand on atheism. Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar interprets and explains in great detail the fundamental reasons behind his atheistic policies. In the second lecture, he maps out Periyar's views on what society is. Periyar is a man who had dedicated his entire life to social work. In the third episode, he explains what he thinks about the Tamil language and his views on the notion of compulsory Hindi and even sent to jail. The purpose of this article is to examine the thoughts of Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar, a Tamil scholar with deep knowledge, long experience and great responsibility for Thanthai Periyar who rationalized the Tamil society in the twentieth century.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Time and Poets in the View of Professor</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. R. Vimala Devi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Literature narrates the experiences of human life. The ideas prevailing in the society of the people are regulated by the literary evidence and the people of the society through the literary works lead the society to improve. Thus the writer benefits society through his/her books. Scholars have lived over time through their books and ideas created. Their thoughts are cherished and preserved from generation to generation. One of the greatest scholars known for such thoughts was Professor Na. Subbu Rediar. He is a versatile scholar, religious thinker, and creator and is deeply attached to the Vaishnava sect. His book “Time and Poets” (Kalamum Kavingarkalum) is a collection of articles published in various magazines. In this collection, he did studies on “Vilibharatham” that has been compared with Bharathi's “Panchali’s Vow” (Panchali Sabatham) with those of the norms of standard Poetry, embellishing the imagination with the scenes he sees naturally, and reveals the characteristics of Bharathi's “Panchali’s Vow”. He points to the glories of the Tamil language and explains “Thirupavai” and “Thiruvembavai” as great proofs of the fact that Paavai Nonpu is Thai neeradal and Margazhi Nieradal is called Amba aadal. He has researched scientific ideas and epic characteristics of Tamils' place in business. Hence, the article seeks to explore how poets evolve through the mind, time, environment, and creative thinking, and explores Professor Subbu Reddiar's multifaceted thinking through his book “Time and Poets”.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Professor N. Subbu Reddiar’s Views on Kambaramayanam</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M.Vijaya Saratha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The story of the epic “Kambaramayana” is briefed along the lines of a folk song “Ayodhi Endroru Rajiyamam Athanai Dasaratha Andaram” which means there was a kingdom called Ayodhi which was ruled by Dasaratha. In the last line of this song, it is written as children do not mock any elder because you would have heard that Rama also wandered and suffered in the forest for fourteen years. After all, he teased Mandarai, an aged person who is also known as Kooni in the epic. The purpose of writing this folk song is contrary to the theme of the epic “Ramayana” written by Kambar. Similarly, whether it is literature or grammar it gets conceived in the mind of the creator as a crux and finally, it will become a piece of work which would vary depending on the creator’s feeling or atmosphere that he is trying to evoke in the readers. But the view of the work can be contrastive, depending on the person who reads it and the period in which he reads it. On that basis, Prof N. Subbu Reddiar has highlighted the relationship levels among the characters, their emotions, the problems he finds in it and Kambar’s expression of culture and beliefs, love, affection, hospitality and devotion of Dasaratha, Lakshmana, Bharatha, Hanuman, Guhan, and Sukrivan towards Rama is explicated in “Kambaramayanam”. Hence, this article elicits a study from the viewpoint of Prof. Subbu Reddiar on “Kambaramayanam”.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the kinds of literature in the Tamil language, Moral literature is praised next to Sangam literature. The family is like a leaf of a tree. It is through this that love like green gives the tree like family gets love. Love is the foundation of Kalavu's (Secret love) life. This feeling of love encompasses all of the love, affection, desire, anger, and fear. These traits are fundamental in the secret life of Tamil society. It also leads to a chaste (Karpu - Married) life. Hospitality is one of the main responsibilities of both husband and wife in marriage life. Hospitality and their domestic duties are associated with the community. The housewife should explain the habit of removing the fear of reproach and distributing the earned material to the relatives. It embodies a sense of duty to society and paves the way for maintaining contact with society. Although the values of literature are constant, they are not all contemporaneous. There are some changes and innovations in the customs from time to time. It is possible to know the lifestyle and true nature of the people of that time through the works mentioned by the witnesses. These suggest that people can live a clean life by removing impurities from their minds and paving the way for future rewards. Hence, the conception of Professor Subbu Reddiar can be seen in the text written by him for Valluvar. It is also commendable for realizing the need of human society, the family relationship, customs and social bonds of the individual, which are relevant for all time, emphasize that the home and the nation will be better off as they are governed by the principle of virtue.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. R. Vishnupriya</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. N. Subbureddiyar has written several multidimensional works. “Palsuvai Virundhu”, the work comprises thirteen parts which include his popular speeches and writings. He deals profoundly into the insight into the theme of caste through his book which is also evident in “Tolkaapiyam” but it never recognises the people directly. Most of the streets are named after the caste. The street name will be perfected when the caste is removed from it. He rightly quotes the words of Thirumoolar - "Ondrey Kulam Oruvaney Devan" as the remedy for the radical change in the society. He considers the work of Thiruvalluvar as a fantabulous work for real life. Subbu Reddiar suggests the reader learn the couplets by using their hearts instead of their minds which is abundantly more than the taste of chocolate and the energy of vitamin capsules. The author thinks that there are 1330 pearls in the room of 133 shells. According to him, “Thirukkural” is the only wealth for human beings in their life. He shares information from medicine, and science and insists to develop research centres for diagnosing the cause and effects of diseases. He has guided how to write history and feels dejected about the new Poets' portrayal of contemporary issues in society through their poetry. Hence, he compares these new poets' views on society with that of the eagle's view. The research paper delineates the varied thoughts on the exposure of the path of Kamaraj, Rajaji, Ramanujar and Periyar as the right path for a good life.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A.Velankanni Amirtha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">The book “Agaththinai Kolgaigal”, written by Professor Subbu Reddiar, serves as a mirror that can reflect the changes and unchanging traditions that have taken place over time in the internal world. Subbu Reddiar explains in detail everything from Sangam literature to contemporary literature, beginning with the interpretation of Agam life. In this book, in the section on Agaththinai Manthargal, he elaborates on who are the Agaththinai Manthargal and their characteristics. This article focuses on the concept of Subbu Reddiar. He divides his book Agaththinai Manthargal into three types, viz. The characters are called Thalaivan and Thalaivi in Tamil. Some others are related to them and are known as Mothers, Fathers, Nurses, Friends, Paangan and Prostitutes. Professor Subbu Reddiar also classifies them as those associated with the chiefs, the Kandor, the Arivar, the Kuththar, the Youth, the Guest, and the Theerpaagan. Professor Subbu Reddiar is like a psychologist who examines the nature of each character and the thought that perceives out of it. He explains that Thalaivi is a little girl when he falls in love and after marriage, he becomes so mature and corrects the Thalaivan. Like the Thalaivi, the Friend has an admirable place in the inner life (agam). She is like another mother who is supportive of the Thalaivi, a teacher who corrects the Thalaivan and corrects his mistakes, and a nurse who has the mentality to deal with the situation. Professor Subbu Reddiar says that the Thalaivan is the one who has loved the Thalaivi and is the one who has received pride and heroism altogether. Similarly, Professor Subbu Reddiar stimulates research thinking by inwardly exploring and comparing the special properties of each character. In this area, Professor Reddiar has used many research approaches such as comparison, analysis, descriptive study, evaluation and synthesis to bring the truth of his research. So, this article ponders over the facts evinced by Professor Subbu Reddiar on agathinai manthargal.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Professor’s Theories of Educational Psychology</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. B. Vaiduriammal</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Psychology is the interpretation of man’s inner behaviours. The condition of today’s students in educational institutions is a major problem. To rectify this, the teacher needs to know the psychology of the students. Many witnesses are well aware of this and emphasize its update in educational psychology. Professor N. Subbu Reddiar has published a separate book on educational psychology. A clear understanding of the two essentials of education is needed if the teacher-student relationship has to be well established. The teacher should treat the students without waiting or helping. A teacher ought to be well-versed in the developmental potential of students. These are all guidelines that teachers generally follow. Professor Reddiar explains the educational messages like this. The academic principles stated by Professor from the guidelines rather than the instructions for the teacher and students will surely help them to achieve new vistas. People who are working in the field of teaching, parents concerned with the education of children, and the general public should be familiar with educational psychology because education is not something that can be poured into one. It is the opinion of Professor Subbu Reddiar that one should achieve by himself. The comments made by Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar are very relevant today. There are many kinds of problems in learning and teaching education. Educational psychology is one of the topics in focus at Global unity. This article is designed to explain, analyze, and compare the psychological knowledge that a teacher should have, students’ awareness, motivation for students, applications of educational psychology, etc. Overall, this article illustrates the views of Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar on the need for educational psychology in today’s context.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. A. Yasodha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the twentieth-century notable personalities is Professor N. Subbu Reddiar. From ancient literature to present-day literature he is an erudite personality. Though he belongs to Shaiva Samaya, he has a passion for Vainava worship too. He is well-versed in Vaishnava literature. This article examines the history of Periyazhvar and his poems in a multifaceted way. Among the twelve Alwars, the significant personality who worshipped Tirumal is Periyazhvar. He won by arguing with many religious people in Madurai with the grace of Lord Vishnu. He is familiarly known as pattarpiran since he sang Pallandu and was revered as Periyazhvar. He sang holy hymns on the incarnation of Kannan. He enjoys celebrating the incarnation of Kannan in a very deep manner. He worships Lord Krishna from Thiruvadi to Thirumudi. For Lord Kanna, the songs are like singing lullabies, looking at the moon and feeding, and adorning with flowers as depicted in Periyazhvar's poems. The lullabies sung by Periyazhvar have developed into the literary genre of Pillai Tamil. Periyazhvar is very much involved in Kannan's mischief and youthful activities. Periyazhvar has written hymns praising the beauty of child Kannan from Yasodha's point of view. In Brindavan, young girls and all living beings are mesmerized by the flute of Kannan. He has also sung hymns in various places in praise of Thirumal. Periyazhvar's poems contain internal components and folk literary elements. The purpose of this article is to explore the various divine experience of Periyazhvar written by N. Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Professor N. Subbu Reddiar’s Language Style from Parani Discourses</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M. Ramadevi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof. Dr. N. Subbu Reddiar delivered lectures on “Kalingattuparani” in the series jointly conducted by Sri Venkateswara University and Pakkala Tamil Sangam which has been compiled into a book titled “Parani Discourses”. (Parani Polivukal). The six-day series has featured professor's lectures titled, Arimugham, Kadai Thirappu, Peigal Ulagam, Varalatru-Kurippugal, Parani Kattum Suvaigal, and Mummanikal. This article is the study of the professor's language personality, which is expressed in these lectures. Generally, personality can be referred to as a superior trait that distinguishes one from others. The personality traits can be found in society, sports, science and politics and can be expressed sometimes as a source of power and a hatred of the ruling but the personality expressed in the fields of literature and language are special to use and stimulate the thought process. In that way, Kalingattuparani’s Sol suvai (word power), Porul suvai (meaning), and Nayam (quality) as explained by Professor Subbu Reddiar stand as an example of his language authority. Perasiriyar explains how “Kalingattuparani” has followed the Tamil literary tradition evinced in “Nannul”, “Munnor mozhli porule yandri avar mozhliyum ponnae pore potruvom”. Perasiriyar's lectures are examples of how a language can act as an instrument for exchanging ideas if expressed by a person who is proficient in that language. The introduction to “Kalingattuparani”, the reason for the name Parani, Parani grammar, the appearance and origin of Parani books, the situation in which it appeared, the elements of Parani books and a lot of other information are given by Perasiriyar Subbu Reddiar never ending as from Akshaya Patra, such is the language personality. Perasiriyar approached through review method, descriptive method, comparative method, historical method, analytical method, and synthetic research method in this research article in his parani discourse on “Kalingattuparani”, Hence, this article delineates the linguistic verve of Perasiriyar Subbu Reddiar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. M. Roopa</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Aram is the first of the four ethical virtues in Tamil society. The virtues are namely Aram, Porul, Inbam and Veeduperu. Our ancestors have made Aram a priority because Aram thrives in this world and if a man becomes honourable, Porul and Inbum will automatically come to Veeduperu. Perasiriyar Subbu Reddiar explains that Aram transcends the sensual pleasures of life and wealth, which can be equated to God. According to Perasiriyar, good deeds and good thoughts are all considered Aram. Perasiriyar stands in the way of Valluvar, he explains that those who attain the highest state of eliminating their births and deaths by dependence on the Lord are the ones who stand on the path of the Lord, both in terms of thought, rationality and virtue. That is in the essence of belonging without showing any difference to other earthly beings. The one who owns it is Anthanar. Also, Perasiriyar emphasises Aram through Valluvar’s way and insists that an unvirtuous person who is selfish cannot become Anthanar. Perasiriyar's explanation for each Kural in the Aran Valiyuruthal Athikaram comes with thought-provoking and insightful ideas that are to be entrenched in our hearts. Perasiriyar also explains that the pleasures that can come from Aram are true. It is the only way to live a virtuous life. It is the way to work for the good of others and to live a virtuous life through the examples of Valluvar. Perasiriyar describes the banana tree as an example of Aram and explains the nature of Aram and its significance such as gratitude, charity, humbleness, respect and obedience towards elders in a clear manner. The purpose of this research article is to analyse how Perasiriyar has explored and explained the general principles that are acceptable to all, such as Valluvam.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. N. Jayasudha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Periyazhvar is the natural name obtained by him for his contributions and devotion among the twelve alwars of Almighty Lord Vishnu. To express the devotion of Periyazhvar (Vishnu Sidhan), Prof. N. Suppuratiyar has published a book bearing his name which has disclosed many specialities on Periyazhvar. In modern life, from the birth of the child to death. everything is planned but they forget to put the credits. Mukunda Pattar and Padmavalliyamai of Sri Viliputhur named their son Vishnu Siddhan. He started to explore from his young days what kind of work and service he can do for Lord Vishnu. He set up a beautiful Nandavanam and prepared garlands for Tirumal every day. His books are “Tirupallandu” and “Periyazhvar Thirumozhi”. Alwar lived till the age of 85. He finds Andal in his Nandavanam and says that she is the divine flower and belongs to Lord Vishnu. All this devotion to God paves the way to salvation. Nowadays, people fail to know the benefits of worship and the chances to accumulate with God. As a Professor, Subbu Reddiar got a great chance to know about the great value and happiness hidden in Vaishnavism and he dug out the secrets of the Tamil world. Professor shares that Periyazhvar has lived his life uniting him with God. He has recorded his ideas that make sense of the spiritual longings of Periyazhvar.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. C. Jayalakshmi</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">It would be beautiful for any poet to compose the greatest epic “Ramayana” in any language. Professor Subbu Reddiar wrote the story as good as the great Valmiki who sang the “Ramayana.” The epic “Ramakatha” tells the story of Rama and his wife Sita, a prince of the Isvaku dynasty from Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala. This story covers many aspects such as duty, heroism, love, femininity, marriage, relationships between relationships, war etc. Everyone born on this earth is indebted to someone in some way. According to Rama, the son must go into exile for 14 years without saying a word. He fulfilled it. It is the duty of the husband to rescue his wife when she is seduced by another man. Love is also beyond many senses. From one sense to the other, this feeling will appear in some way in the epics. Many Sangam literature songs are about love and war. Sangam literature and ancient Tamil grammar tell us about love and heroism. The heroism of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Ravana, Kumbha Karna, Indrajith and Vali are still talked about by the people today. Marriage is the formation of a bond between the couple. This bond will continue till the end of life. Life thrives on the exchange of love for one another. No one has the power to make love because it is immortal. Professor Subbu Reddiar has seen all such glimpses of Tamil culture in the epic “Ramayana”. So, he wanted to elicit to his reading audience, he had written many articles on “Ramayana” with startling comments analyzing the characters. Hence, this article focuses to bring forth the perspectives of Professor Subbu Reddiar to the present-day admirers of Subbu Reddiar and the Tamil academic world.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>T. Hemavathy &amp; Dr. P. Vimala</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">During the kingdom of Aaditya Karigala Cholan, there were around Forty Holy Thirupathis in the Chola regime out of 108 Vaishnava Holy Scripts. Prof. N. Subbu Reddiar in his book elicits about the importance of Holy Thirupathis, the specialities of the temples, the architectural design of the temples, the significant beauty of Perumal, the melody of Mangala Saasanam sung by the Alwars and their worship. In this research paper, the study is specific to the Holy Thirupathis of the Chola regime, which magnifies the inherent and boundless affection rendered by Alwars to Perumal. The Alwars' devotion to the lord and the sweet melodies sung by them has been gathered through the book “Oorum Perum”. Further, it had been the customary practice of Alwars to visit the temples and praise the Lord Vishnu shows their devotion to reach Perumal. With this miraculous power, Thirumazhaisai Alwar made the king marry the lady. The importance of the faith of Vaishnavism is popularly envisioned with the spiritual adherence to Perumal by the Twelve Alwars. When Karmega Kannan visits the place, the young girls of the place who has attained maturity attract him with melodious and romantic songs. Krishna’s magical tune in dancing style on the forehead of “Five Headed Serpent” (Kaarkodak) and protecting the Aayarpadi people by lifting the mountain “Kovarthan” and also killing the female monster had been the greatest wonders of Krishna and the alwars sing of these chivalric actions through their melodious songs. Consequently, the collection of hymns and melody songs was compiled into a series of 4000 songs called “Nalayira Divya Prapantham” sung by Alwars. The divine respect for Perumal by Periyalwar can be seen through the wedlock of Aandal with Perumal. Aandal became popular as Goddess, thereby attaining glory with Perumal. Hence, Perumal is glorified by the incarnation of Archavathara through the observations of Subbu Reddiar based on the Thirupathis flourished at the times of the Chola Regime. The article elaborates on the ideas of Reddiar on the holy Thirupathis at the time of the Chola regime.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Religious Gift of Professor N. Subbu Reddiar</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dr. S. Hemalatha</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Religion has been at the centre of tradition that has been followed for a long time in Tamil Culture. Saivam and Vaishnavism are two religions which have been practised since ancient times in Tamil Nadu. Due to the passage of time many religions spread in Tamil Nadu and degraded the status of the Vedic and Vaishnava religions. During the Pallava period, Nayanmars and Alvars defended, contributed and developed the Vedic and Vaishnava religions. Perasiriyar Subbu Reddiar belongs to the Saivam sect, he is well-versed in Saiva Sithandham and Thirumurai. He has written many texts explaining many of the messages implied in this literature for the easy understanding of the common people. Although he belonged to the Saivam religion, he was interested in Vaishnavism for which he produced Vaishnavaite Puranas and epics (Ithihasangal) in simple Tamil and added pride to the Tamil language. He visited the holy shrines of Vaishnavism and also sang the specialities of each verse with his songs, dividing the verses region-wise in the way it is said in ancient times. Through this, he has further developed both the religions of Saivism and Vaishnavism. Thus, Professor has made personal pride not only for religions but also for the Tamil Language. Professor Subbu Reddiar has written more religious texts and has learned through Tamil literature. Hence, the purpose of this study is to establish the religious contributions of Professor Subbu Reddiar.</p>
